    """
    Generalized statically-typed sparse storage-invariant matrix primitive.

    Notes
    -----

    Matrix typical usage:

    - Instantiate matrix primitive
    - Build incrementally from yours data source
    - Matrix usage in a sequence of math operations
    - Read-back matrix data to python to analyse results

    Steps (2) and (4) requires internal format transformations and possible transfer of data
    from acc (GPU) side if acceleration was employed in computations. These steps may be very
    intensive, so you have to avoid them in critical parts of computations. If you need faster
    data reads, prefer usage of batched reads, where all content of storage read at once.

    Details
    -------

    Matrix class support all spla C API matrix functions.
    It provides bind functionality as well as new functions/methods for better python user experience.

    Matrix internally manages optimal format of stored data. Use hints to
    force matrix state and format changes.

    Matrix optional uses dedicated/integrated GPU to speedup computations
    using one of built-in OpenCL or CUDA accelerators.
